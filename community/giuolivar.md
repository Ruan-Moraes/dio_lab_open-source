Giuliana Rodrigues
Welcome! Here you'll find a collection of projects and repositories that reflect my interests, skills, and contributions to the world of technology and open source. Feel free to explore, collaborate, and provide feedback on any of the repositories you find interesting.

About Me
I'm a passionate learning enthusiast and I have been studying the industry of technology and aiming to change career paths. My journey in the world of code began when I  finished my master's in a completely different field. This background actually brought me to study and comprehend the tecnologies that revolve around us in order to find more ethical ways to using it. I know the road is long to achieve this goal, but since then, I've been dedicated to expanding my knowledge, trying to solve real-world problems, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible through code.

Let's Collaborate
I'm passionate about collaborating with others and making a positive impact through technology. If you're interested in collaborating on a project, have a question, or just want to chat, please don't hesitate to reach out. Together, we can build amazing things, little by little!


Thank you for reading and I look forward to connecting with you! ðŸ˜Š
